Content for the Midterm Coding Project for CS 510 (Fall 2021)

This program contains the research I am currently conducting with Dr. Patricia Lopes in analyzing differentially expressed (DE) genes in quail subjects that were subjected to different treatments. For our research/independent study, we are interested in measuring the immune response levels of female quails who were either paired with healthy or sick males. The DE analysis is conducted using BioConductor R packages and the builk of the analysis is contained within this R file/project. 

To run the project, simply step through each line of the code or run the whole R file. 

NOTE: Make sure to download and install the packages listed in the top of the R file before running the program.
